## 👋 About This Project

This repository contains my **personal portfolio website**, built to showcase my work as a:

> **Frontend Engineer × AI Developer**

The goal of this project is not just visual appeal, but to demonstrate:
- Real-world frontend architecture
- Clean, scalable UI patterns
- Performance-first development
- Production-grade deployment with SSL & custom domain

---

## 🧠 Case Study: Design & Engineering Decisions

### 🎯 Problem
Most developer portfolios:
- Look visually good but lack depth
- Don’t explain *how* things are built
- Aren’t optimized for recruiters or hiring managers

### 💡 Solution
I designed and built a **single-page portfolio** that:
- Loads fast
- Communicates expertise clearly
- Balances design + engineering
- Scales for future AI experiments and labs

---

### 🎨 Design Philosophy
- Dark, modern UI with subtle gradients
- Clear typography hierarchy
- Motion used with intent (not decoration)
- Minimal but expressive visuals

---

### 🛠 Engineering Choices
| Decision | Reason |
|-------|------|
| Vite | Fast dev server & optimized builds |
| React + TypeScript | Predictable, scalable UI |
| Tailwind CSS | Utility-first, consistent design |
| shadcn/ui | Accessible, composable components |
| Netlify | Zero-config CI/CD, SSL, and domain management |

---

## ✨ Features

- Fully responsive layout
- Smooth scroll-based navigation
- Animated hero and section transitions
